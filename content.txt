GEAR UP

This 4 week part-time course is geared towards beginners with little-to-no experience in programming. Over the course of 20 classes, students will learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript - also known as Front-End Web Development. At the end of the course, students will be adept at creating static websites, building simple web applications, and have a good sense of whether or not programming may be a career they would like to pursue.

Week 1 covers the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, Week 2 starts off with basic JS operations, conditionals and loops. At the end of week 2 you get to practice what you've learned in a mini-hackathon. Week 3 goes into more depth by studying different datatypes and getting introduced to functional programming. Finally week 4 you'll learn more about object oriented programming and MVC architectures.
